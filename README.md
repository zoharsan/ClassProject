# ClassProject
Project submission for Coursera class Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains the run_analysis.R script which follows each step required for the class project. Note that the first command setwd() which sets the working directory is optional, but points R to the root of the Samsung data set and allows to navigate with relative paths from that point on.

If this script is to be copied and ran on another system, the setwd() would be the only one which needs to be customized.
The script contains generous explanatory comments for each step.
